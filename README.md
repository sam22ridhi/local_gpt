# Local GPT Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a powerful local GPT-based solution leveraging advanced language models and multimodal capabilities. It integrates LangChain, LLaMA 3, and ChatGroq to offer a robust AI system that supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved context-aware responses. The system also includes audio and vision components for a more immersive and interactive experience.

## Features

- **LangChain**: Used for managing conversational flows and chaining multiple language model operations.
- **LLaMA 3**: A cutting-edge language model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **ChatGroq**: Provides advanced conversational capabilities and enhances the chatbot’s responsiveness.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines language generation with retrieval mechanisms to enhance responses based on external data sources.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**:
  - **Audio Processing**: Converts speech to text and enables voice interactions.
  - **Vision Processing**: Analyzes and understands visual content for a richer interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installing Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/local-gpt-project.git
cd local-gpt-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Additional Setup

1. **Download and configure LLaMA 3 and ChatGroq models**:
   Follow the instructions provided in the respective documentation to download and configure these models.

2. **Set up API Keys**:
   If using APIs for audio and vision processing, ensure you have API keys and configure them in `config.yaml`.

## Configuration

1. **`config.yaml`**: Modify this file to include your API keys and model configurations.

   ```yaml
   llama_model_path: /path/to/llama3/model
   chat_groq_model_path: /path/to/chatgroq/model
   audio_api_key: YOUR_AUDIO_API_KEY
   vision_api_key: YOUR_VISION_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Set environment variables for sensitive information such as API keys:

   ```bash
   export AUDIO_API_KEY=YOUR_AUDIO_API_KEY
   export VISION_API_KEY=YOUR_VISION_API_KEY
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the application by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Interacting with the System

1. **Text-Based Interaction**:
   Use the command-line interface or web interface to interact with the chatbot.

2. **Audio Interaction**:
   Record and upload audio files or use a microphone for real-time interactions.

3. **Vision Interaction**:
   Upload images or use a camera for visual input.

### Example

Here’s how to use the system for a text-based query:

```bash
python main.py --query "What is the capital of France?"
```

For audio interaction, record your query and upload it:

```bash
python main.py --audio-upload /path/to/audio/file
```

For vision-based queries, upload an image:

```bash
python main.py --image-upload /path/to/image/file
```

## Code Structure

- **`main.py`**: Entry point of the application.
- **`models/`**: Contains model files and configurations.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions for audio, vision, and text processing.
- **`config.yaml`**: Configuration file for setting up models and API keys.
